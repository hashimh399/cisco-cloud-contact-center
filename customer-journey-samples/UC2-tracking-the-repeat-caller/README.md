## Getting Started

This video shows you how to use the bmclella_Voice_JDS_1.json file to import into Flow Builder to build this use case. There is an assumption that you have downloaded the postman collection of API's
to test out your logic before updating the flow.

Remember to configure the following Local variables

- `workspaceId` - Project Id from Control Hub
- `Token` - Set this value a valid token used to access JDS. An example to create this can be found by looking for the token-service-sample, taking the token genereated from Postman or your own process.
