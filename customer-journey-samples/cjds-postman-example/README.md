## Getting Started

This video doesn't necessarily need any additional setup as it is demonstrated using Postman and using the sample script in the video.

Import the JSON collection into Postman to begin using it.

Remember to configure the following environment or local variables

- `client_idJDS` - Your Datacenter e.g us1
- `client_secretJDS` - Your Queue ID
- `org_idJDS` - Your Org ID
- `baseUrl` - Starting URL to your JDS Post
- `workspaceId` - Project Id from Control Hub

Keep in mind that you still need to have your Postman setup with your authorization or at least using an unexpired Access Token to run this API.
